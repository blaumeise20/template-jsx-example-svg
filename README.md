# Template JSX examples

This repo contains an example generating SVG images with the package [template-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/template-jsx).

It was originally created for a session in the [Angular Meetup Graz](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Angular-Meetup-Graz/). Note that this example will not be continuously maintained. I will update it every now and then whenever I use it. If you update and/or extend it, feel free to send me a pull request.
